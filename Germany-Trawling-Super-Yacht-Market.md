Their popularity has been rising due to their superior performance in terms of speed and operational ease. Additionally, motor yachts offer a high degree of customization, attracting affluent customers who seek a blend of functionality and opulence.</p><p>Sailing yachts, on the other hand, offer a more traditional and eco-friendly option, using wind power for propulsion.
