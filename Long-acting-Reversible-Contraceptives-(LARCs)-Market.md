This growth can be attributed to the rising awareness about family planning, government initiatives promoting birth control, and the increasing preference for long-term, non-invasive contraceptive solutions. LARCs, including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants, offer women a reliable and reversible method of contraception with extended effectiveness, making them a preferred choice for many. The market's expansion is further driven by advancements in healthcare infrastructure and increased accessibility to contraception in developing regions.</p><h2>Long-acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>In terms of application, the LARCs market is segmented primarily into family planning, population control, and therapeutic applications. Family planning remains the largest segment, with a significant portion of the global population opting for LARCs as a primary method of contraception due to their effectiveness and ease of use. The growing preference for long-term contraceptive methods in developed regions, coupled with increasing awareness in emerging markets, is driving this segmentâ€™s growth. LARCs, like IUDs and implants, provide women with a reliable, reversible, and hassle-free solution for controlling reproduction, contributing to the expansion of the family planning segment.</p><h2>Long-acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) Market, By Application Segmentation</h2><p>The population control segment is also a significant application area for LARCs, particularly in regions with high population growth rates.
