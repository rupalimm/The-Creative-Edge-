These boxes are especially popular for the transportation of goods like clothing, electronics, and groceries, where secure, organized, and reusable packaging is crucial. Additionally, the turnover boxes support better inventory management, reduce product damage during transportation, and ensure faster handling during sorting and delivery processes, contributing to overall cost savings for retailers and distributors.
